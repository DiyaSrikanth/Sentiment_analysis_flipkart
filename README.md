🚀Hi! Recently completed a sentiment analysis of Real-time Flipkart Product Reviews! 🚀 

An NLP task where the data collected was used to model and predict whether the given reviews were positive or negative.

👩‍🏫Here's the rundown.

Data preprocessing: 

📃Performed text cleaning, normalization, and applied numerical feature extraction techniques such as BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec.

Modeling: 

💠Explored various machine learning and deep learning models using embedded text data. 

✔Evaluation metrics used for this project was F1-score.

Model Deployment:

🌶Flask web application that takes user input in the form of a review and generates the sentiment of the review. 

🔷Integrated the trained classification model into the Flask app for real-time inference.

🕸 The app was then deployed on an AWS EC2 instance for public access.

And that's that!
